## Assignment summary 

You will strategise on this assignment in groups, but submit the assignment individually. In class, decide on the best order of functions to complete your task.  Then, either alone or with other students, prepare a short R script that reads in the BWG database and applies a sequence of steps to address one of the data cleaning tasks listed below(and/or any other data cleaning task that your group sees fit). Write a brief description of the issues with the data and the approach you developed to resolve it - even if you developed the code with other students this part should be done individually.
